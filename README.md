# 💻 Welcome to the APSC 160 Final Exam Practice Problems Set! 💻

> **Disclaimer:** These questions are not officially endorsed by APSC 160's teaching team, they are just TAs' opinions.


## Overview
Where are we? This is git, a software that is used by all programmers to store code. You are currently on Github, a platform that hosts git code (like how YouTube hosts videos; Git and Github are not the same thing). 

This guide is meant to server you as an additional resource to studying for the APSC 160 Final. We **strongly** recommend to check out `tips.md` too for additional advice!

### For C Questions

You will have a question file, `problem.md`, and 3 C files:

- `template.c` Write your code here.
- `testing.c` Run this file. Change the `#include` at the top to run either `template.c` or `solution.c`, **do not change anything else**. If your program can get all the test cases here your solution is correct. 
- `solution.c` Do not change anything here. Answers are here.

### For Arduino Questions

## How to Use This Repository

<ins> For the C questions, There are two different ways: </ins>

### 1. OnlineGDB

Copy and paste the template and solution files into onlineGDB. Make sure to use the *new file* button to create 3 separate files (and more if it's a file I/O question). **Make sure to put `testing.c` in the main file.** You can do this copy and paste method on other IDE's too if you are too lazy to do it the Git way below.

### 2. Using Git

> Note: Only Windows (10/11) OS does not have Git pre-installed

For those who want to use their own IDE (VSCode, VS, Codeblocks, etc), click *Code* and *Copy the HTTPS link*. Navigate to your directory of choice. Then in *Terminal* or *Command Prompt*. Clone the repository using the following:
``` bash
git clone [https://github.com/Daylen1160/APSC160-FinalPractice-2025.git]
```

Now open the folder in your IDE and run from there!
