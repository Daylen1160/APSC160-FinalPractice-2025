**Recommended Time:** 5 - 10 min 
**Topics:** Arrays, Functions, Loops, Control

## Description
Given an array of integers `nums`, complete the 3 methods to:
1.  Calculate the **sum** of all elements in `nums`.
2.  Calculate the **average** of all elements in `nums`.
3.  Calculate **how many values are greater than or equal to the average** in `nums`.

## Input / Output
* **Input:** `nums`, `numsSize`
* **Output:** In separate methods, return the sum, the average, and the number of elements greater than the average respectively.

## Requirements
* Implement each method independently and check to make sure the previous method works before moving onto the next with the test cases.
* Each method builds off the last, so **reuse the previous method**

## Examples

```text
Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 5
Output:
15
3
3
Explanation: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15. The average of those values is 3. 3, 4, and 5 are greater than or equal to 3, so we return 3.
